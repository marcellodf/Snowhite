      <p><img border="0" src="carriage2.GIF" width="72" height="44"> <font size="5">I</font>n the beginning of the19th century, the main mode of
      transportation was the horse and carriage.&nbsp; It wasn't until the
      latter part of the century that railways changed people's lives and
      habits.&nbsp; But even after the advent of the railway, remote areas still
      relied on the horse for local transport.&nbsp; Following is a brief
      summary of the types of vehicles used to get around.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Carts, drays, vans and wagons were generally used for

      orders.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Carriages carried people in England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Barouches, landaus, victorias, curricles and broughams were all
      carriages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They varied in
      body shape and number of horses pulling them.<o:p>
      </o:p>

      hood at the back and with two inside seats facing each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      century.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Berlin--A big four-wheel carriage with a hood.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Curricle--A two-wheel carriage that was fashionable
      in the early 1800s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
      pulled by two horses and deemed sporty by the younger set.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Gig--A two-wheel vehicle intended for single-horse
      driving by an owner.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Landau--Open, fancy carriage with four wheels with a
      hood at each end and two seats opposite each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It was popular in the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Two horses pulled the landau.</p>

      century, they were most often four-wheel carriages.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="Black2.gif" width="32" height="32"><b>FOR

      <p class="MsoNormal">Hansom--Invented in the 1830s, it had two wheels and

      eventually replaced the cabs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
      was introduced into the United States later in the century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>By the 1890s, tires were rubber, making the ride smoother.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Omnibus--The first one appeared in London in 1829 and
      carried about 22 passengers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By

      top.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They carried 12
      passengers inside and 14 on top.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They

      countryside for carrying heavy goods and people who didn't have the money
      to travel fast.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Dray--a cart with no sides used for hauling heavy
      loads.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Van--A covered-over, lightweight version of the
      waggons used for hauling goods, and sometimes for people.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="Black2.gif" width="32" height="32"><b>COACHES</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Coaches were enclosed, four-wheel vehicles used for
      long-distance travel.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Stagecoach--coaches which stopped at various
      pre-appointed stages in order to pick up and drop off passengers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They were the only way to visit people not on the mail coach
      routes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were built to
      carry the same passengers as the mail coaches.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Mail coaches--subsidized or owned by the post office
      and painted uniformly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They

      OF AMERICAN ORIGIN</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Road Wagon, Dog-cart, and Surrey--Were most useful
      for country work and for fast trotting.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Rockaway--Usually relegated to country use, as it was
      difficult for the coachman to drive in crowded streets on a low seat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>They were either closed or open.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Runabout--The most generally used light wagon for two
      passengers.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Wagonette--lightweight and led by two horses, it was
      useful in the country because it carried a large number of passengers with
      the least effort to the horses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
